        <strong>Project: Personalized Advertising Engine</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Led the design and implementation of a new personalized advertising
            engine, resulting in significant improvements in click through rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initiated and drove collaboration with sales and product teams to
            establish deliverable milestones and project success metrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conducted initial validation, revealing a 5x increase in CTR over a
            substantial sample size. This led to a secondary test to increase
            sample size issue, which yielded a 2.5x increase.

        <strong>Project: Data Latency and Throughput Optimization</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a Kafka-based event architecture with the goals of
            resolving data latency and throughput.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initial design primarily targeted non-mission critical data
            requirements, resulting in a substantial cost reduction of 20 times
            compared to the existing system. This was achieved by transitioning
            from a per-event cost structure to a per-gigabyte cost model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondary milestone focused on piecewise transition of mission
            critical revenue systems, presently handling a daily volume of a
            million events.
