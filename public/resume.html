      <strong>BIO<br /></strong>
      My name is David Zhang.<br />
      I am a Toronto based web, rails, whatever-is-needed developer. I fill my
      life with technology from sci-fi stories to building webapps. I am
      particularly passionate about building complex back-end systems that
      support <strong>crisp</strong> UX designs.<br /><br />
      During my spare time, I like to dabble with different art forms, living a
      life of imagination, and playing some DotA. I love urban exploration,
      especially when there is food involved. Overall I pride myself as a
      hipster and realist, and a little funny.<br /><br />
      This portfolio is meant as a hub into my life.
